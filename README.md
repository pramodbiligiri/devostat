# code-flow
Claude plugin for an agentic coding workflow.  

## Main features of the workflow:
- Generate a plan file before implementation
- Plan files are tracked in version control, and can be modified safely whenever the implementation approach changes
- The tasks created from a plan (and its modifications) are pushed to an issue tracker for easy monitoring
- You can pause the work any time and resume easily, thanks to the extensive tracking

### Other features:
- Plans default to breaking down the feature into vertical slices
- Test Driven Development along with Integration tests

## Installation

**From within Claude Code:**

First, register the marketplace (one-time setup):
```
/plugin marketplace add pramodbiligiri/claude-plugins
```

Then install the plugin:
```
/plugin install code-flow@pramodb-plugins
```

---

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Java 21
- Maven

### Build the dev version

```bash
mvn process-resources
```

This produces a `build/` directory containing a complete `dev-code-flow` plugin variant:
```
build/
  skills/dev-code-flow/SKILL.md
  .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json
```

### Register the dev build with Claude Code

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
"extraKnownMarketplaces": {
  "code-flow-dev": {
    "source": {
      "source": "directory",
      "directory": "/path/to/code-flow/build"
    }
  }
},
"enabledPlugins": {
  "code-flow@pramodb-plugins": false,
  "dev-code-flow@code-flow-dev": true
}
```

Replace `/path/to/code-flow` with the absolute path to this repo.

### Usage

Start Claude in any project. The `/dev-code-flow` slash command invokes the dev build.

### Switching back to production

Toggle `enabledPlugins` in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
"enabledPlugins": {
  "code-flow@pramodb-plugins": true,
  "dev-code-flow@code-flow-dev": false
}
```

### Notes
- Restart Claude after each `mvn process-resources` run to pick up changes
- `build/` is gitignored — it is always a local, derived artifact

---

A Claude skill for a development workflow that's built on the following assumptions:
- You build software in vertical slices as much as possible.
- You create a plan (roughly corresponds to a feature or some logical unit of work) for the code changes and then start implementing it. But you're open to modifying the plan midway based on how it's going.
- You might get blocked or have to pause the work (for any number of reasons) and resume it later.
- For every plan, all its versions are permanently checked into the source control system
- Testing is integrated as a fundamental part of the workflow — each task requires a failing test before implementation, and coverage is verified before committing
- TODO: Enable the dev to choose the sequence of tasks (maybe they'll develop the riskier or more unknown parts of the feature first)
- Each task is committed after tests pass and coverage is verified, creating a rollback point per task
- TODO: Rename plan to spec, all across the skill?
