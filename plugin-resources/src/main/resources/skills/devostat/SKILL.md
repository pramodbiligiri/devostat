# ${plugin.skillName} — Agent Coding Workflow

## When to apply this skill
Apply this skill whenever you are:
- Starting work on a new feature or task
- Asked to write, revise, or execute a plan
- Picking up existing work from Linear
- Closing out, abandoning, or handing off a plan

---

## Core Invariants — Never Violate These

1. **Features vs Plans are strictly separate.** Feature issues live in the permanent backlog forever. Plan issues live in transient `[agent]` projects and are archived after completion. Never create feature issues inside an `[agent]` project.
2. **A committed, pushed, human-reviewed plan is the contract.** You execute against it. You do not autonomously modify it.
3. **Every plan must reference at least one permanent backlog feature issue.** `[Linear]` Create an `[agent]` project linking to it. `[Local]` Record it in the `<backlog-issue>` metadata element of the tasks XML file. If no backlog issue exists, stop and create one before proceeding.
4. **Task tracking is never the source of truth for plan content.** Git is. Linear (or the local tasks file) tracks task state only.
5. **Tags are permanent.** Never delete a plan version tag from remote, even on abandonment or squash merge.
6. **Tests precede implementation.** Write integration test(s) before any task code (Phase 2 preamble), then the unit test for each task before its implementation. Never implement without a failing test already committed. (Apply as far as possible — migrations and config may not be TDD-able.)

---

## Task Tracking Mode

This workflow supports two task tracking modes. Choose one at the start of each plan:

- **`[Linear]`** — Uses Linear issues and projects. Requires a Linear account and the Linear MCP server configured in Claude Code.
- **`[Local]`** — Uses a local XML file at `.agents/plans/plan-{N}-tasks.xml`. No external services required. Requires the plugin's SessionStart hook to have run (installs `fast-xml-parser` and compiles the task scripts into `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/dist/`).

Throughout this skill, instructions marked `[Linear]` apply only in Linear mode; instructions marked `[Local]` apply only in Local mode. Unmarked instructions apply to both.

`[Local]` Script invocations use `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/dist/<script>.js`. All scripts read/write `.agents/plans/plan-{N}-tasks.xml` relative to the repo root.

## Control Strategy: The Risk-Quality Loop

To maximize productivity while minimizing "hallucination drift," apply an adaptive control strategy.

**The Control Equation:**
$$u[k] = K_S(R) \cdot \frac{\Delta e[k]}{T_s} + K_Q \cdot \frac{e[k]}{T_s}$$

- **$K_S(R)$ (Spiral Risk Gain):** Sensitivity to architectural or logic drift. High when risk is unknown.
- **$K_Q$ (Implementation Quality Gain):** Sensitivity to code quality, readability, and test coverage.
- **$T_s$ (Sampling Interval):** Frequency of human intervention. Smaller $T_s$ = tighter control.

**Strategy:** De-risk aggressively first (High $K_S$, Low $K_Q$). Once logic is proven, harden the code (Low $K_S$, High $K_Q$).

---

## Repository Structure

```
.agents/
  plans/
    plan-07.md            # plan files live here, versioned in git
    plan-07-tasks.xml     # [Local] task state (sibling to plan file)
```

Plans are markdown files. They contain: narrative, design decisions, architecture notes, open questions, and references. Code never goes here.

---

## Git Tagging Convention

Every time a plan file is committed and pushed, immediately create and push a version tag:

```bash
# After committing a plan file change:
git tag plan-07-v1
git push origin plan-07-v1

# Subsequent revisions:
git tag plan-07-v2
git push origin plan-07-v2

# On clean completion:
git tag plan-07-complete
git push origin plan-07-complete

# On abandonment (tag the deletion commit too):
git tag plan-07-abandoned
git push origin plan-07-abandoned
```

Tag naming: `plan-{N}-v{version}` for iterations, `plan-{N}-complete` for clean closeout, `plan-{N}-abandoned` for abandonment.

### Automate with lefthook

Commit a hook so tagging fires automatically on every push, regardless of whether a human or agent made the commit:

```yaml
# lefthook.yml
pre-push:
  commands:
    auto-tag-plans:
      run: |
        # Detect if any .agents/plans/ file changed in the push
        if git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -q '^\.agents/plans/'; then
          PLAN=$(git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD | grep '^\.agents/plans/' | head -1)
          PLAN_ID=$(echo "$PLAN" | grep -oP 'plan-\d+')
          # Find next version number
          LATEST=$(git tag -l "${PLAN_ID}-v*" | sort -V | tail -1)
          if [ -z "$LATEST" ]; then
            NEXT="${PLAN_ID}-v1"
          else
            N=$(echo "$LATEST" | grep -oP '\d+$')
            NEXT="${PLAN_ID}-v$((N+1))"
          fi
          git tag "$NEXT"
          git push origin "$NEXT"
          echo "Auto-tagged: $NEXT"
        fi
```

Install lefthook if not present: `npm install -g lefthook && lefthook install`

---

## Linear Structure

`[Linear]` only. Skip this section in Local mode.

### Permanent Backlog Project
- Named e.g. `AppName — Backlog & Roadmap`
- Contains feature issues only
- Human-created and human-prioritised
- Never deleted, survives all plan lifecycles

### Transient Agent Projects
- Named: `[agent] {N} · {short-description}` e.g. `[agent] 07 · home-accounts-settings-bottom-tabs`
- Created per plan, archived after completion
- Project description must contain:
  - Link to the permanent backlog feature issue(s) it delivers
  - Permalink to the plan file using the tag-based commit hash URL (see below)
  - Brief plan narrative / design rationale

### Tag-based GitHub permalink format
```
https://github.com/{org}/{repo}/blob/{tag-commit-hash}/.agents/plans/plan-07.md
```

Resolve the commit hash for a tag:
```bash
git rev-list -n 1 plan-07-v1
```

Use this hash (not the tag name) in Linear links — it is immutable and survives branch deletion, rebases, and squash merges.

---

## Phase 1 — Plan, Calibrate, & Commit

**You do not write or run any implementation code during this phase.**

1. **Draft Plan:** Write or update the plan file at `.agents/plans/plan-{N}.md`.
2. **Risk Analysis:**
   - For every task in the plan, suggest a **Default Risk Level** (Low, Medium, or High) with a one-sentence justification.
3. **Collaborative Calibration:**
   - **Stop.** Ask the human: *"I've estimated these risk levels. Do you want to override any of them?"*
   - The human's choice becomes the **Actual Risk ($R$)**.
4. **Risk-Sorted Task Ordering:**
   - Re-order tasks in the plan file in **descending order of risk** ($High \to Med \to Low$).
   - *Exception:* If a Low-risk task is a hard technical dependency for a High-risk task, the dependency must come first.
5. **Commit & Tag:**
   ```bash
   git add .agents/plans/plan-07.md
   git commit -m "plan(07): risk-calibrated plan for [short-description]"
   git push origin t/{issue-id}-{short-description}
   # Lefthook auto-tags plan-07-v1 and pushes it
   ```
6. **Verify Preconditions:**
   ```bash
   git status                          # must be clean
   git log origin/t/{issue-id}-{short-description}..HEAD  # must be empty
   git tag -l "plan-07-v1"             # must exist
   git ls-remote origin "plan-07-v1"   # must be on remote
   ```
7. **Create Task Tracking Infrastructure:**
   - `[Linear]` Create the `[agent]` Linear project. Create Linear issues from the **risk-sorted** plan tasks. Each issue description must include the **Risk Level** ($L/M/H$) and the tag-based GitHub URL of the specific plan version that generated it.
   - `[Local]` Run `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/dist/init.js --plan {N} --tasks-from .agents/plans/plan-{N}.md` to generate `.agents/plans/plan-{N}-tasks.xml`. Commit the XML file immediately after creation.
   - Organise tasks as **thin vertical slices** in both modes.
8. **Final Review & Go-ahead:**
   - `[Linear]` **Stop.** Post to the Linear project that the risk-sorted plan is ready for review.
   - `[Local]` **Stop.** Tell the human the XML task file has been committed and the plan is ready for review.
   - **Wait for explicit human go-ahead before proceeding to Phase 2.**

---

## Phase 2 — Execute

**Step 0: Create a branch**

Create and push a branch named after the primary Linear issue for this plan:
```bash
git checkout -b t/{issue-id}-{short-description}
# e.g. git checkout -b t/pb-149-branch-creation-step
git push -u origin t/{issue-id}-{short-description}
```
All task commits go on this branch. The `t/` prefix stands for "task" (covers features, bugs, chores, etc.). Usernames are intentionally omitted — the task identity is what matters long-term.

**Before writing any code**, confirm the test coverage threshold with the human (default: 95%). Record the agreed value before proceeding.

### Preamble: integration tests (once, before any task)

1. Write 1–2 integration tests that exercise the feature end-to-end. No more than two.
2. Commit and push them with no implementation — they must fail (red). `[Linear]` Reference the Linear project in the commit message.
3. Confirm red state:
   ```bash
   # run your project's test command, e.g.:
   npm test          # or: pytest, go test ./..., etc.
   ```
   If a test passes at this point, it is testing the wrong thing. Fix or discard it before continuing.

### Per-task loop (The De-risk & Harden Cycle)

For every task in the risk-sorted sequence, apply the appropriate sub-phases:

#### High and Medium risk tasks — De-risk & Harden Cycle

##### Step A: De-risking (Spiral Phase)
- **Goal:** Validate logic and architectural direction. Ignore "Implementation Quality" rules.
- Write at least one failing test that targets the core logic (preserving Core Invariant #6).
- Implement just enough to prove the approach works. Focus on the core complexity.
- Commit as `draft(N): de-risk [task name]`.
- `[Linear]` Post a comment on the Linear issue notifying the human the draft is ready.
- `[Local]` Run `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/dist/update-status.js --plan {N} --task {id} --status de-risked` and `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/dist/add-comment.js --plan {N} --task {id} --message "De-risk draft ready for review"`.
- **Wait for explicit approval of the approach.**

##### Step B: Hardening (Quality Phase)
- **Goal:** Achieve technical excellence, human readability, and coverage threshold.
- Refactor the de-risked code for readability, performance, and project patterns.
- Write full unit tests and ensure coverage meets the agreed threshold:
  ```bash
  # example — adjust to your toolchain:
  npm test -- --coverage --coverageThreshold='{"global":{"lines":95}}'
  ```
- Commit the completed task (tests + implementation):
  ```bash
  git commit -m "task(N): <short description>"
  git push origin t/{issue-id}-{short-description}
  ```
  This creates a stable rollback point. A human reviewing the PR can check out this commit to inspect each task in isolation.
- `[Linear]` Mark the Linear issue **Agent Coded**.
- `[Local]` Run `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/dist/update-status.js --plan {N} --task {id} --status agent-coded` and `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/dist/set-commit.js --plan {N} --task {id} --commit $(git rev-parse HEAD)`.

#### Low risk tasks — Single-pass (current behavior)

1. Write the unit test(s) for this task. Commit them failing (red).
2. Implement the task. Run tests until green.
3. Check coverage meets the agreed threshold:
   ```bash
   # example — adjust to your toolchain:
   npm test -- --coverage --coverageThreshold='{"global":{"lines":95}}'
   ```
   Do not proceed until coverage passes.
4. Commit the completed task (tests + implementation):
   ```bash
   git commit -m "task(N): <short description>"
   git push origin t/{issue-id}-{short-description}
   ```
   - `[Linear]` Mark the Linear issue **Agent Coded**. No draft review needed.
   - `[Local]` Run `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/dist/update-status.js --plan {N} --task {id} --status agent-coded` and `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/dist/set-commit.js --plan {N} --task {id} --commit $(git rev-parse HEAD)`. No draft review needed.

---

- **Minor deviation** (task split, reorder, clarification):
  - `[Linear]` Update the Linear issue(s), add a deviation comment explaining why, continue.
  - `[Local]` Run `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/dist/add-deviation.js --plan {N} --task {id} --type minor --message "..."`, continue.
- **Major deviation** (fundamental plan problem, architecture issue, blocked): Stop immediately.
  - `[Linear]` Post a Linear project update. Set project health to **"At Risk"**.
  - `[Local]` Run `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/dist/project-update.js --plan {N} --blocked --message "..."`.
  - Wait for the human to revise the plan file, commit, push, and give a new go-ahead.

Never autonomously modify the `.agents/plans/` file during execution. If a plan change is needed, surface it and wait.

---

## Plan Closeout

### Clean Completion
```bash
git tag plan-07-complete
git push origin plan-07-complete
```
- `[Linear]` Close all Linear issues in the `[agent]` project. Mark `[agent]` project complete and archive it. Update the permanent backlog feature issue to reflect delivery (link to completing PR, note what was delivered).
- `[Local]` Run `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/dist/project-update.js --plan {N} --status complete --message "Plan complete."`. Commit the final XML state. Update the permanent backlog feature issue (if tracked externally) or note delivery in the plan file.

### Completion with Loose Ends
- `[Linear]` Label unresolved issues `needs-triage`. Set `[agent]` project to **"In Review"**. Post a project update listing each open issue and why it's unresolved. Wait for human to review: they will promote worthy issues to the permanent backlog or discard them. Human marks the project complete and archives it.
- `[Local]` Run `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/dist/update-status.js --plan {N} --task {id} --status needs-triage` for each unresolved task. Run `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/dist/project-update.js --plan {N} --status in-review --message "..."`. Commit the XML. Wait for human to review.

### Abandonment
- Human commits a plan file deletion with a commit message referencing the superseding plan number
- You tag the deletion commit:
  ```bash
  git tag plan-07-abandoned
  git push origin plan-07-abandoned
  ```
- **Do not delete any earlier tags** (`plan-07-v1`, `plan-07-v2`, etc.) — they are the audit trail
- `[Linear]` Surface all open tasks for human triage. Migrate worthy tasks to the permanent backlog with a note: "Partial delivery — see plan-07-abandoned, superseded by plan-{M}". Archive the `[agent]` project with a closing note referencing the deletion commit hash and the superseding plan.
- `[Local]` Run `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/dist/project-update.js --plan {N} --status abandoned --message "Superseded by plan-{M}."`. Commit the final XML state.

---

## Audit Trail

`[Linear]` Record in every Linear issue:

| Event | What to store in the issue |
|---|---|
| Task created | `github.com/.../blob/{plan-07-v1-hash}/.agents/plans/plan-07.md` |
| Task closed / obsoleted | `github.com/.../blob/{plan-07-vN-hash}/.agents/plans/plan-07.md` + one-line reason |

`[Local]` The XML file is the audit trail. `<created-from>` and `<closed-at-version>` attributes on each `<task>` serve the same role. The XML is versioned in git, so `git diff` between two plan tags shows exactly what changed.

If the creation version equals the closeout version, the plan never changed during execution. If they differ, the git diff between the two tag hashes shows exactly what changed and why.

Feature issues in the permanent backlog should accumulate references to every plan that contributed to them — this gives a full delivery history across the feature's lifetime.

## What Lives Where — Quick Reference

| Content | Location | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Plan narrative, design decisions, references | `.agents/plans/*.md` in git | Needs diffs, version history, co-evolution with code |
| Task state (done / not done) | `[Linear]` Linear `[agent]` project · `[Local]` `.agents/plans/plan-{N}-tasks.xml` | Needs status tracking and human review |
| Feature definitions | `[Linear]` Linear permanent backlog · `[Local]` Noted in plan file Context section | Permanent, human-curated |
| Link between plan version and tasks | `[Linear]` Tag-based GitHub permalink in Linear issue description · `[Local]` `<created-from>` attribute in XML | Immutable, survives branch lifecycle |
